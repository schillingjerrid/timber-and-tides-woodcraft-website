## Overview

This piece was built as a commission focused on clean lines, long-term durability, and a warm, natural look that would age well.

## Build notes

- Started with rough walnut, milled flat and square
- Apron joinery: mortise and tenon
- Edges softened with light roundovers to keep it comfortable in daily use
